    <h1 style = "text-align:center;"> About </h1>
    
    <p> I'm a 5th year PhD student in applied math at Columbia university working on PDEs on large-graph limits, 
      as well as variational inference--adjacent studies. In particular, I'm working with graph Ginzburg--Landau
      theory and properties of some graph dynamics in the graphon limit. I'm interested in some applied graph theory 
      problems, including opinion dynamics, disease dynamics, and image segmentation. 
      My work with variational inference relates to proving theoretical guarantees for mean-field variational inference,
      studying Wasserstein gradient flows, Fokker-Planck equations and their convergence properties. 
      I am a passionate teacher and I am seeking teaching opportunities.
